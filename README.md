# Farmer Management System
<P> The Farmer Management System is a C++ console-based application that stores farmer details and calculates agricultural requirements automatically.
It uses structures to organize farmer data and functions to compute water, seed, fertilizer, and season based on crop type.
The program supports multiple farmers using a loop and vector container.
Input handling is done carefully to avoid buffer issues.
This project demonstrates core C++ concepts such as structures, functions, conditionals, loops, and vectors in a real-world scenario. </P>
